### Agile Geoscience Kata Solutions

The files in this repository are my solutions to these challenges. If you are looking to do these 
[Agile Geosciences](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2020/4/16/geoscientist-challenge-thyself) 
challenges on your own then please visit this
[Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eP68NTV-GA3R-BYUh-CUxcgYDQ5IuetS) put together by
[Agile Geoscience](https://agilescientific.com/) to get started.

You can run these dashboards directly from the github raw links after installing Streamlit. For example,
```
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armstrys/Kata-Geochallenge-Solutions/master/Kata-Fossil-Hunting.py
```
