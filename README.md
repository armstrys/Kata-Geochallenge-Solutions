### Agile Geoscience Kata Solutions

The files in this repository are my solutions to these challenges. If you are looking to do these [Geocomputing Kata (challenges)](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2020/4/16/geoscientist-challenge-thyself) on your own then please visit this [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eP68NTV-GA3R-BYUh-CUxcgYDQ5IuetS) put together by the folks at [Agile Geoscience](https://agilescientific.com/) to get started.

You can run the [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboards in this repository by calling `Streamlit run` on the Github raw link for a file within an Python environment that has Streamlit installed. For example,

```
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armstrys/Kata-Geochallenge-Solutions/master/Kata-Prospecting.py
```

Dependencies:
* Streamlit
* Requests
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
