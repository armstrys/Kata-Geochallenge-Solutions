      "text/markdown": "# Boreholes\n\nYou have a list of boreholes. Each one has an (x, y) location. The locations are given as a Python string, and look like this:\n\n    ..., (12.1, 34.3), (56.5, 78.7), (90.9, 12.1),...\n    \nYour data, when you receive it, will be longer than this.\n    \nWe're going to analyse these locations. We need the answers to the following questions:\n\n1. How many boreholes are there? We'll call this number _n_.\n2. What's the distance, **to the nearest metre** between the first two boreholes in the list?\n3. What is the mean straight-line distance between all pairs of boreholes **to the nearest metre**? Call this _m_.\n4. There is a clump of boreholes. How many boreholes are in the clump? (A borehole is defined to be in a clump if the mean distance to its nearest _n_ / 5 neighbours is _m_ / 4 or less.)\n\nPlease note that all your answers must be integers. If you get a float for an answer, round it.\n\n\n## Example\n\nHere are the locations of some boreholes:\n\n      (1, 4), (5, 4), (9, 3), (2, 8), (6, 4), (9, 9), (5, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (2, 1)\n      \nIf we plot them, they look like this:\n\n    y\n    ^\n    9 - - - - - - - - - 0\n    8 - - 0 - - - - - - -\n    7 - - - - - - - - - -\n    6 - - - - - - - - - -\n    5 - - - - 0 0 - - - -\n    4 - 0 - - - 0 0 - - -\n    3 - - - - 0 - - - - 0\n    2 - - - - - - - - - -\n    1 - - 0 - - - - - - -\n    0 - - - - - - - - - -\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 > x\n    \nHere's how we'd answer the questions for this small dataset:\n\n- In this example, there are **10** wells (marked `0` on the plot above).\n- The distance between the first two boreholes in the list, (1, 4) and (5, 4), is **4**.\n- The mean distance between boreholes is 4.58... which to the nearest metre is **5**.\n- There are **4** wells in the clump. See below.\n\nWells in the clump are marked `X` here (the borehole marked `O` does not meet the criterion):\n\n    y\n    ^\n    9 - - - - - - - - - 0\n    8 - - 0 - - - - - - -\n    7 - - - - - - - - - -\n    6 - - - - - - - - - -\n    5 - - - - X X - - - -\n    4 - 0 - - - X X - - -\n    3 - - - - O - - - - 0\n    2 - - - - - - - - - -\n    1 - - 0 - - - - - - -\n    0 - - - - - - - - - -\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 > x\n\n\n## A quick reminder how this works\n\nYou can retrieve your data by choosing any Python string as a **`<KEY>`** and substituting here:\n    \n    https://kata.geosci.ai/challenge/boreholes?key=<KEY>\n                                                   ^^^^^\n                                                   use your own string here\n\nTo answer question 1, make a request like:\n\n    https://kata.geosci.ai/challenge/boreholes?key=<KEY>&question=1&answer=1234\n                                                   ^^^^^          ^        ^^^^\n                                                   your key       Q        your answer\n\n[Complete instructions at kata.geosci.ai](https://kata.geosci.ai/challenge)\n\n----\n\nÂ© 2020 Agile Scientific, licensed CC-BY"
